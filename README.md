# Solana Off-Chain Signature Verification PoC

This repository contains **exploratory and experimental** material. It may be modified or deleted at any time.

The project demonstrates a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** showing how a Solana program can verify a message that was **hashed and signed off-chain** before instruction execution.  
It serves as a **preflight verification** mechanism to ensure message authenticity prior to on-chain processing.
